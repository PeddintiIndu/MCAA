<h1>About AFM</h1>
<p><pre>Accounting and financial management are distinct but complementary disciplines crucial for any business. 
Accounting focuses on recording, summarizing, and reporting financial transactions, primarily for external stakeholders
 and internal decision-making. Financial management, on the other hand, is concerned with planning, organizing, directing,
 and controlling the financial resources of an organization to achieve its goals.  </pre></p>
